      "User: YES.\n\nI’m still just trying to figure out how things work in Visual Arts—what skills people actually use, how they start, that kind of thing. Not ready for anything formal yet. It’s like when you watch a movie and notice how the camera moves, but you don’t try to make one yourself right away. I’m in that noticing part."

      "User: YES! I’m absolutely in the awareness phase right now. I’m not looking for a job or training—I’m just trying to wrap my head around how sustainability and renewable energy are reshaping accounting and management. For example, I’ve been wondering how financial reporting standards are evolving to include ESG metrics, or whether regulatory frameworks in Brazil are keeping up with global trends.\n\nIt’s fascinating but also a bit overwhelming, especially when colleagues still prioritize traditional financial performance over long-term sustainability. I just want to understand the landscape better before deciding how—or if—I should adapt my skills."
