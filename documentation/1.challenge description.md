# How the challenge works
You'll build an AI assistant that interacts with simulated personas - each representing a young person in Brazil with unique goals, skills, and readiness levels. These personas are accessed through an API and include details such as age, education, experience, skills, and motivations.

Your assistant must engage in natural conversations, ask clarifying questions, and offer tailored guidance. This is not about applying static rules - it's about using agentic AI to actively support each persona's journey.

For every interaction, your system must decide whether to:
recommend jobs, along with trainings to fill any skill gaps,
recommend trainings only, if the persona is focused on learning,
or provide awareness content, if the persona isn't yet ready for jobs or trainings.

## Example Story
Persona: Maria, 17, lives in Recife and recently completed a vocational course in environmental technology. She is passionate about sustainability and wants to explore career paths that contribute to a greener future.

Interaction: Maria logs into Green Community Hub UNICEF Platform (it is simulated for the Challenge)

System Response:
“Welcome, Maria! Based on your background in environmental tech, here are some job opportunities in renewable energy and sustainable agriculture. To strengthen your profile, we recommend these trainings in carbon accounting and circular economy practices.”

Decision: Recommend jobs + trainings

Why: Maria is job-ready and actively seeking green career opportunities.

Otherwise: Some personas are not yet ready for jobs or trainings, because they are younger then 16 or just looking for information. In these cases, your assistant should provide awareness content to help them explore and learn.

# What you'll work with
The AI assistant engaging with diverse personas via API-based natural language conversations, ask relevant questions, and offer personalized guidance - not follow static rules.

For every interaction, your Agentic AI System should either recommend jobs with training for any skill gaps, suggest trainings if the persona is focused on learning, or provide awareness content if they're not ready for jobs or training.

## What is the data source and evaluation?
The data in GDSC 2025 is fully AI generated and curated by our team. We have generated job descriptions, trainings and personas.

You will get access to a structured dataset of job descriptions and trainings, with which you will build a multi agentic solution to make sense of the data, interact with the user, extract user data such as skills or goal, match the user profile to jobs/trainings and give users recommendations for jobs, trainings or awareness content, based on the user's preferences.

For evaluation, your solution will interact with personas, which mimic real young people in Brazil with different skills, profiles and ambitions. Your solution's recommendation for jobs/trainings/awareness content will be a submission which will be evaluated and scored.

## Provided Technologies
You will have access to a sandbox AWS environment, where there is a developer environment to build your solution. You can also build locally if you wish.

You will also have access to Mistral API thanks to our partnership this year, where you can access Mistral models.

We also encourage to use the Strands SDK to build the multi-agent solution, an open-source framework developed by AWS and easily configurable to use Mistral models.

## Challenge Expectations
We will provide a detailed rules guide in the notebooks. In general, for each persona, your assistant should do one of the following:
Jobs+Trainings: List compatible jobs (meeting all hard filters) and required trainings for missing skills, following a strict progression sequence if one exists.
Trainings_only: List trainings relevant to the persona's goals that are above their current level; in standalone mode, provide only the immediate next level (or Básico if no levels exist).
Awareness: Return "too_young" or "info" based on the persona's situation.

## How you'll be evaluated
Your solution will be assessed based on:
Accuracy of job matching (respecting all hard filters).
Completeness of gap analysis, ensuring all missing skills are covered with proper training progression through Básico → Intermediário → Avançado when available.
Relevance of training-only recommendations (respecting the new “next level only” rule).
Correctness of awareness classification ("too_young" or "info").
