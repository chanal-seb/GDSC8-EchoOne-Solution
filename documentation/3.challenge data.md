# Understanding the Challenge Data
## The Mission (kinda cool actually)
We're helping young people in Brazil find green jobs. UNICEF partnership, climate action, meaningful careers - the whole deal. And because it's 2025 we will build AI agents that can sift through job descriptions and training programs, match them to people's profiles, and do it efficiently and ethically!

The Brazilian green jobs landscape we're working with:
- Major cities: São Paulo (finance & tech hub), Rio de Janeiro (energy & environment), Brasília (policy & government), Salvador (renewable energy), Recife (innovation centers)
- Key sectors: Renewable energy (solar, wind, hydro), sustainable agriculture, environmental consulting, green construction, waste management
- Companies leading the charge: Petrobras (transitioning to renewables), Vale (sustainable mining), Suzano (sustainable forestry), plus hundreds of green startups
